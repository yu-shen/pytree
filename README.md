# Welcome to pytree
Python implementation of a self-balancing binary search tree.

## Introduction
Python is powerful, and versatile, yet easy to use, making it a great choice for a wide variety of application. However
python's standard library does not include a balanced binary tree which is a data structure critically important in
helping achieving optimal time and space complexity for many real world problems. The purpose of this project is to
implement a self-balancing AVL tree in python https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree with worst case time complexity of
O(log N) for search, insert and delete, and worst case space complexity of O(N).
